In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed 
independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.
The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a 
thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing 
concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources.
In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its dynamically allocated 
variables and non-thread-local global variables at any given time.
